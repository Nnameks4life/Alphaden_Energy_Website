        Following the award of the rights to commercialize flare gas from a flow
        station in Bayelsa State by Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC), we began
        development of our Obama Gas Flare Commercialization Project (OGFCP)
        which includes construction of a gas processing plant for the
        commercialization of the currently Flared gas at the F/S with Urea, LPG
        & LNG being the target products. We are a front runner company in the
        integrated design, construction, and project management of Flare Gas
        recovery & commercialization facilities. We also pride ourselves on our
        expertise to deliver global LNG capacity as well as offshore & terminal
        facilities through our proprietary technologies or strategic alliances
        with process licensors and vendors. We are qualified to deliver optimum
        performance on both new construction and upgrades.

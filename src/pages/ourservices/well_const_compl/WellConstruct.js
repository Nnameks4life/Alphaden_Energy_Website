        Regardless of environments, we utilize our extensive expertise,
        operational excellence and strong capabilities to deliver complex
        construction projects, whether these developments are greenfield or
        brownfield, onshore or offshore, upstream or downstream.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are commercially flexible, offering a range of different commercial
        models tailored to meet the needs of our clients. We have extensive
        lump-sum turnkey expertise (LSTK) in onshore engineering, procurement
        and construction (EPC) and offshore engineering, procurement,
        construction and installation (EPCI). We also provide engineering,
        procurement and construction management (EPCm) services too as part of
        our extensive portfolio.

        Cementing Services: The cement sheath that seals your well from
        formation fluids is, ultimately, an investment in safety and
        environmental stewardship. In addition to supporting the casing, the
        sheath offers a sealed barrier that protects the casing from corrosion
        and underground source drinking water from contamination. Our optimized
        cement systems and automated mixing equipment enable precise, safer
        slurries that match well conditions while minimizing rig time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alphaden cementing experts are committed to superior engineering.
        Leveraging advanced design technology, advanced fluid displacement
        simulator, we apply high-quality products and additives using
        high-performance equipment for dependable, long-term cementing in every
        well, every time.

        <h1>Well Servicing</h1>
        <p>
          Well servicing encompasses the many activities performed on wells,
          such as initial completion (opening the wellbore to its initial
          producing zone), re-completion into additional producing zones,
          stimulation (injecting fluids and materials to increase production),
          diagnostics and maintenance. This work is most often accomplished
          using well servicing rigs, although rigless operations are also
          common.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphaden makes use of simple yet powerful tools and systems to improve
          the performance of well servicing operations. These systems track well
          service jobs and break each operation down for both time and cost
          analysis.

          Well Intervention Services: Whether you are operating onshore,
          offshore or subsea, Alphaden will help you construct your well safely
          and in the most efficient manner. Our solutions range from surface and
          subsea wellheads, to specialty connectors and pipes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Get reliable performance over the life of your well, while reducing
          risk. Alphadenâ€™s comprehensive portfolio of wellbore construction
          technologies helps eliminate non-productive time and lower the overall
          cost of well construction. From liner hangers, to multilaterals, solid
          expandable monobores, and wellbore isolation systems, these solutions
          ensure your operations run smoothly from the start.

        <h1>Problems We Solve</h1>
        <p>
          Every technology Alphaden makes use of is carefully engineered and
          rigorously tested to ensure well integrity, productivity, and pressure
          control. Our products and services are crafted to tackle specific
          problems, such as hole size, technical limitations, pressure
          requirements, and safety concerns in even the most challenging
          applications, like deepwater or extended reach wells. So, you can
          avoid unplanned interventions and create the ideal wellbore from
          formation to surface
        </p>

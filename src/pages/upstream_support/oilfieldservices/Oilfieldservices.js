        Producing oil and gas at the lowest achievable cost per barrel starts
        long before production is online. Opening with a deep knowledge of the
        reservoir, the process expands to placing wells properly, drilling each
        of them professionally, and finalizing them reliably and effectively. At
        Alphaden, we offer a viable, strong & reliable technology and service
        portfolio for each fragment of the process, jointly with unequaled
        digital capabilities. We continuously engage in working out ways to
        achieve new levels of upstream productivity.

        <h1>WELL COMPLETION AND SIMULATION</h1>
        <div className='line' />
        <p>
          Production performance begins with an outstanding completion – from
          the reservoir to the production facility. Whether it’s a conventional
          well or the utmost complex subsea multilateral, we make it our goal to
          understand our clients’ completion challenge. Drawing from the
          industry’s broadest portfolio of proven products and innovative
          technologies, our clients’ will get the specific infrastructure and
          well integrity solution needed to produce safely and efficiently for
          the life of our client’s asset.

        <h5>Coiled Tubing Systems & Services</h5>
        <p>
          Coiled tubing (CT) is essential to many well site operations. But, the
          greatest value is much more than conveyance: It’s the performance
          accomplished at the end of the pipe.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the surface and downhole, we offer practical solutions for well
          cleanouts, stimulation, and many other specialized applications. Our
          CT deployment teams help you achieve notable operational and economic
          performance advantages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, our Tubing Research and Engineering Team improves and extends CT
          applications, drawing upon a practical blend of research and field
          experience.

          Wellbore Cleanup: Our wellbore cleanup and displacement technology
          improves operational competence by reducing risk and nonproductive
          time. Wellbore cleanup mechanical tools and chemicals remove debris
          that interferes with normal operations without damaging the well
          structure. We offer a steadfast, engineered and field-proven solutions
          for effective wellbore cleanup and debris management to ensure
          successful completion operations and to maximize reservoir returns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our complete suite of wellbore cleanup mechanical tools includes
          products for displacement, casing cleaning, blowout preventer (BOP),
          riser cleaning, and debris management. The solutions we offer
          includes, displacement simulation, torque-and-drag analysis and load
          analysis. Irrespective of where you are working on, land, offshore, or
          in deepwater wells, you can count on us to save you time and money.

            Sand Control: We know that sand production is tough on equipment,
            and on your investment. Having this in mind, we make use of a
            holistic approach to sand control starting with understanding your
            reservoir, and ending with a solution that addresses the unique
            challenges of each well. With a broad collection of sand screens,
            multizone stimulation systems, and gravel-pack tools, we can help
            you effectively connect to the reservoir, ensure maximum
            conductivity, and enhance recovery. We will continue to innovate so
            you can maximize sand-free production and improve your recovery
            factors.

              Pressure Pumping Services: Pressure pumping is a circulation of
              fractures through layers of rock using pressurized fracturing
              fluid and pumping the cement into the well bore to complete it.
              This approach is primarily used to extract resources from low
              permeability reservoirs such as shale gas, tight gas, and
              unconventional liquids, which are difficult to recover through
              regular drilling procedures.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hydraulic fracturing is the frequently used pressure pump service,
              worldwide. Also, cementing services, sand control services,
              acidization, are also a part of the industry. Currently, pressure
              pumping is facing a lot of public opposition on environmental
              hazards caused by fracturing. Water usage, water contamination,
              and seismic activities are the most important concerns of pressure
              pumping. Due to these environmental concerns, the growth of the
              global market is diminished with a ban in many countries on
              hydraulic fracturing.
